Notes on methodology:

All total energy calculations were performed using plane-wave Density Functional Theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP, v.6.2.1) 24–26. 
The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional 27 and Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) pseudopotentials 28 were used to represent each element. 
The Hubbard U (GGA+U) approach29,30 to the V 3d states was applied. The value of U =3.25 eV was chosen to be consistent with those used for calculations in the Materials Project (MP) database 31,32 and other studies 33. 
All DFT calculations were spin-polarized, initialized in a ferromagnetic spin configuration. 
A plane-wave cutoff energy of 520 eV was used to expand the orbitals, and the Brillouin zone was sampled using the Methfessel-Paxton scheme. 
Monkhorst-Pack grids 34 with a spacing of 0.314 Å−1 were used. The atomic coordinates were fully relaxed during the DFT simulations until the forces on each atom were within 0.05 eV/Å.
